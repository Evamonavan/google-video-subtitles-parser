Preamble
--------
The initial purpose of this mini project was to parse [1] Google Video's 
provided spanish subtitles [2] of Randy Pausch's great 'Last Lecture' [3], 
and convert it to other subtitle file formats (if you take a look at Google, 
many people are looking for it).

This can provide a source of 'open/closed captions' [4][5], that can be placed 
or embedded in alternative movie file formats like MP4, 3GP, AVI, or others; or 
simply used at play time using a video filter like VSFilter or FFDShow.

At the time I'm writing this, I can also say that I'm a real novice in XML 
parsing with Java, but I'm learning with this [6], so don't expect beautiful 
or efficient code at this time. Instead YOU can give me a hand to beautify it, 
improve its efficiency or make another contribution to improve it.

It's a personal desire that Randy's message reach a broader audience, and as 
long as I still don't owe a Randy Pausch DVD [7] (I want it [8], maybe at the 
end of the year) but I've already downloaded a couple of versions from 
YouTube/Google Video and I'm willing to make an 'in house' version to show it 
to my Dad, other relatives and friends.


Project
-------
The project is simply an utility that provides an XML parser for Google Video 
transcriptions, and provides translators for some of the most common subtitle 
file formats [9]. In the future it could be extended to cover another Video 
sharing websites (e.g. YouTube, file a ticket if you're interested).

API can be considered currently unstable and may change in following releases 
with proper justification.


Distribution
------------
For distribution terms see COPYING.LESSER file in distribution archive.


Usage
-----
Current implementation works if video URL or transcript URL is provided. 
Desired language subtitle track may be provided as part of the URL, if not it 
will be prompted as user input from available list of subtitle tracks.

From jar distribution:
$ java -jar google-video-subtitles-parser.jar net.jmt4b04d4v.gvideo.sax.GoogleVideoSAXParser URL

Alternatively from binary distribution at google-video-subtitles-parser/build/java/classes
$ java net.jmt4b04d4v.gvideo.sax.GoogleVideoSAXParser URL


Current status
--------------
Currently, it provides translators for:
 * SubRip (.srt)
 * SubStation Alpha (.ssa)
It needs more testing to guarantee its accuracy. I had Time Zone issues which 
still have hacky fixes.


To do list
----------
 * More documentation [I1-DONE].
 * Get Video Transcript URL from Video URL [DONE].
 * Handle locale of desired Subtitle (discuss alternatives/selection) [I2-DONE].
 * A new 'fancy' style for SubStation Alpha subtitles [I3].
 * A handle to override SubStation Alpha default style [I4].
 * A handle to provide SubStation Alpha meta data [I5].
 * Implement more translators (extensions of AbstractTranscriptFormatter or 
   new implementations of ITranscriptFormatter) [I6].
 * No more ToDo here, use Google Code Issues [16] instead.
